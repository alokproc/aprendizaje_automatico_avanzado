    "These graphs show that the training loss decreases with each epoch, and that the training accuracy increases, which indicates that the optimization procedure is working properly (especially regarding the loss function). But in this case we observe that the same does not happen with the validation, which begin to worsen from the first epochs. This is a clear case of overfitting: after a few steps the system over-adjusts to the training data, and learns a representation that is specific to this data and cannot be generalised to other data.\n"
